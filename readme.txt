To get the mapping tool to work on your computer, you have to replace each instance of the file
location of the program in the main.py to the location of the files on your computer.
These occur on the following lines: 102, 127, 231, 457. 
This will also need to be done in Map.aspx.cs in the MiTasksWAA solution.
